Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For 
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point - 
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.

## Getting Started (Next.JS)

To set up and run the Next.js project locally, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).

## Using NVM (Node Version Manager)

To manage Node.js versions easily, it's recommended to use NVM. If you don't have NVM installed, follow these steps:

## Install NVM

#### Mac OS
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows
https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases

## Install project dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Run the Development Server

```
npm run dev
```
This will launch the application locally, and you can access it in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
